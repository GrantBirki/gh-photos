# Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

This GitHub CLI extension has been fully implemented according to your specification and constitution:

### 🏗️ Core Architecture (Library-First)

**✅ Types Library** (`internal/types/`)

- Asset struct with full metadata support
- Asset classification (photos, videos, screenshots, burst, live_photos)  
- Privacy filtering (Hidden/Recently Deleted exclusion by default)
- Target path generation with date-based structure
- SHA256 checksum computation

**✅ Photos Database Parser** (`internal/photos/`)

- SQLite Photos.sqlite parsing with modernc.org/sqlite (no CGO issues)
- Core Data timestamp conversion
- Asset flag extraction (Hidden, Recently Deleted, Screenshot, Burst, Live Photo)
- Database validation and error handling

**✅ Backup Parser** (`internal/backup/`)

- iPhone backup directory validation
- Photos.sqlite and DCIM discovery
- File system integration and validation
- MIME type inference

**✅ Manifest System** (`internal/manifest/`)

- Complete JSON manifest generation
- Operation status tracking
- Summary statistics and reporting
- Human-readable output with file size formatting

**✅ Audit Trail System** (`internal/audit/`)

- Comprehensive audit trail with `~/gh-photos/` management
- Timestamped permanent manifest files (`manifest_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.json`)
- Latest manifest symlink/copy (`manifest.json`)
- Complete device and invocation metadata capture
- Per-asset tracking with status, size, checksums, metadata
- `--use-last-command` functionality for repeatability

**✅ rClone Integration** (`internal/rclone/`)

- Cloud-agnostic upload wrapper
- Parallel upload support with semaphore limiting
- Upload plan generation and dry-run support
- File existence checking and verification
- Skip-existing functionality

**✅ Main Orchestrator** (`internal/uploader/`)

- Complete end-to-end workflow orchestration
- Asset filtering by date, type, and flags
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation

### 🎯 CLI Implementation (Cobra-Based)

#### ✅ Main Command Structure

- `gh photos sync <backup-path> <remote>` - Main sync command
- `gh photos validate <backup-path>` - Backup validation
- `gh photos list <backup-path>` - Asset listing
- Full flag support matching specification requirements

#### ✅ All Required Flags Implemented

- `--dry-run` - Preview operations
- `--include-hidden` / `--include-recently-deleted` - Privacy controls
- `--skip-existing` - Incremental sync support
- `--verify` - Post-upload verification
- `--parallel N` - Concurrency control (default: 4)
- `--types` - Asset type filtering
- `--start-date` / `--end-date` - Date range filtering
- `--save-manifest` - JSON manifest output
- `--checksum` - SHA256 computation
- `--root` - Custom root prefix (default: "photos")
- `--save-audit-manifest` - Additional audit manifest copy location
- `--use-last-command` - Re-run last successful command from audit history

### 📁 Upload Structure

#### ✅ Organized Date-Based Hierarchy

```text
photos/
├── 2024/
│   └── 09/
│       └── 17/
│           ├── photos/
│           ├── videos/
│           ├── screenshots/
│           ├── burst/
│           └── live_photos/
```

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

#### ✅ Privacy-Safe Defaults

- Hidden assets excluded by default
- Recently Deleted assets excluded by default
- No credential storage (relies on rClone)
- Local-only processing
- Comprehensive audit trails

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

#### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite

- Unit tests for all core libraries
- Table-driven tests following Go best practices
- CLI command testing with Cobra
- Test coverage reporting
- Integration test structure

#### ✅ Documentation

- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Contributing guidelines
- Code structure documentation
- Privacy and security guidelines
