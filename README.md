## About ‚≠ê

This project is a [`gh cli`](https://github.com/cli/cli) extension that extracts photos and videos from unencrypted iPhone backup directories and uploads them to cloud storage using [rclone](https://rclone.org/). The tool intelligently parses the `Photos.sqlite` database to classify assets by type and organizes them into a clean folder structure on your chosen cloud provider.

**Key Features:**

- üì± Extracts photos from unencrypted iPhone backups
- üóÇÔ∏è Organizes uploads by date and asset type (`photos/YYYY/MM/DD/<category>/`)
- üîê Privacy-safe defaults (excludes Hidden/Recently Deleted albums)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Supports all **rclone** remotes (Google Drive, S3, OneDrive, etc.)
- ‚ö° Parallel uploads for faster performance
- üîç Asset classification (photos, videos, screenshots, burst, Live Photos)
- üìã Manifest generation for operation auditing
- üß™ Dry-run mode for safe testing

# Validate an iPhone backup directory
gh photos validate /path/to/backup

# List assets found in backup
gh photos list /path/to/backup

# Upload to nested folder structure on the remote - This creates: Google Drive/Backups/iPhone/2024/YYYY/MM/DD/
gh photos sync /path/to/backup gdrive:Backups/iPhone/2024

# This creates: Google Drive/Photos/family-photos/YYYY/MM/DD/
