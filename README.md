A gh cli extension for uploading iPhone photos from a backup dump to a remote target using rclone and logical defaults.

![logo](docs/assets/logo.png)

## About ‚≠ê

This project is a [`gh cli`](https://github.com/cli/cli) extension that extracts photos and videos from unencrypted iPhone backup directories and uploads them to cloud storage using [rclone](https://rclone.org/). The tool intelligently parses the `Photos.sqlite` database to classify assets by type and organizes them into a clean folder structure on your chosen cloud provider.

**Key Features:**

- üì± Extracts photos from unencrypted iPhone backups
- üóÇÔ∏è Organizes uploads by date and asset type (`photos/YYYY/MM/DD/<category>/`)
- üîê Privacy-safe defaults (excludes Hidden/Recently Deleted albums)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Supports all **rclone** remotes (Google Drive, S3, OneDrive, etc.)
- ‚ö° Parallel uploads for faster performance
- ÔøΩ Smart defaults (skips existing files to save bandwidth)
- ÔøΩüîç Asset classification (photos, videos, screenshots, burst, Live Photos)
- üìã Manifest generation for operation auditing
- üß™ Dry-run mode for safe testing

## Installation üíª

Install this gh cli extension by running the following command:

```bash
gh extension install grantbirki/gh-photos
```

### Upgrading üì¶

You can upgrade this extension by running the following command:

```bash
gh ext upgrade photos
```

## Finding iPhone Backup Paths üì±

The CLI automatically walks directory structures to find your iPhone backup. You can provide any of these common parent directories, and the tool will locate the actual backup folder:

### Windows Backup Locations

```bash
# Common Windows iPhone backup paths (the CLI will auto-navigate to the backup folder)
C:\Users\<username>\Apple\MobileSync\
C:\Users\<username>\Apple\MobileSync\Backup\
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
```

### macOS Backup Locations

```bash
# Common macOS iPhone backup paths (the CLI will auto-navigate to the backup folder)
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/
/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/
/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/
```

**Smart Path Resolution**: The CLI automatically detects if you've provided a parent directory and will:

1. Look for a `Backup` subdirectory
2. Check if that contains `Manifest.db` or `Manifest.plist` files
3. If there's a single backup folder inside, navigate into it
4. Validate that it's a proper iPhone backup directory

This means you can simply point to `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/` and the tool will find the actual backup directory automatically.

## iTunes Backup Extraction üóÇÔ∏è

The `extract` command allows you to extract unencrypted iTunes/Finder backups into a readable directory structure before processing. This is useful when your backup files are in the hashed format that iTunes uses internally.

### Why Extract?

iTunes and Finder create backups with hashed filenames (like `00/1a2b3c4e5f...`) instead of the original file names. The extract command:

- ‚úÖ **Reconstructs original paths** using the backup's `Manifest.db`
- ‚úÖ **Organizes by domain** (MediaDomain, HomeDomain, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Only supports unencrypted backups** (encrypted backups are rejected for security)
- ‚úÖ **Shows progress and provides detailed summary**
- ‚úÖ **Optionally verifies file integrity** with checksums

### Extract Examples

```bash
# Basic extraction (creates ./extracted-backup/)
gh photos extract /path/to/backup

# Extract to specific directory
gh photos extract /path/to/backup ./my-extracted-backup

# Extract with verification and progress
gh photos extract /backup ./extracted --verify --progress

# Skip files that already exist
gh photos extract /backup ./extracted --skip-existing
```

After extraction, you can run normal sync operations:

```bash
# Extract first, then sync
gh photos extract /path/to/backup ./extracted
gh photos sync ./extracted/MediaDomain gdrive:photos
```

## Usage üöÄ

The `gh-photos` extension provides three main commands for working with iPhone backup photos:

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Extract iTunes/Finder backup to readable directory structure
gh photos extract /path/to/backup
gh photos extract /path/to/backup ./extracted-backup

# Sync photos from iPhone backup to Google Drive
gh photos sync /path/to/backup gdrive:photos

# Dry run to preview what would be uploaded
gh photos sync /path/to/backup gdrive:photos --dry-run

# Validate an iPhone backup directory
gh photos validate /path/to/backup

# List assets found in backup
gh photos list /path/to/backup

# Upload to nested folder structure on the remote - This creates: Google Drive/Backups/iPhone/2024/YYYY/MM/DD/
gh photos sync /path/to/backup gdrive:Backups/iPhone/2024

# This creates: Google Drive/Photos/family-photos/YYYY/MM/DD/
gh photos sync /backup gdrive:Photos --root "family-photos"
```

### Advanced Usage Examples

```bash
# Sync with custom settings (skips existing files by default)
gh photos sync /backup gdrive:photos \
  --include-hidden \
  --parallel 8 \
  --checksum \
  --save-manifest manifest.json

# Filter by date range and asset types
gh photos sync /backup s3:mybucket/photos \
  --start-date 2023-01-01 \
  --end-date 2023-12-31 \
  --types photos,videos

# Upload to custom root directory (skipping existing files by default)
gh photos sync /backup gdrive:photos \
  --root "family-photos" \
  --verify

# Force overwrite existing files
gh photos sync /backup gdrive:photos \
  --force-overwrite \
  --verify

# List assets with filtering
gh photos list /backup \
  --include-hidden \
  --types screenshots,burst \
  --format json
```
